            <h3 class="lb_heading">Rachel Greene</h3>
            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"NO UTERUS, NO OPINION!"</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Rachel Karen Greene (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likable daughter of Dr. Leonard Green (Ron Leibman), a rich, Long Island vascular surgeon, and Sandra Green (Marlo Thomas). She has two sisters, Jill (Reese Witherspoon) and Amy (Christina Applegate). Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry Farber, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents. She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three attended Lincoln High School. In the first episode, she is also reacquainted with Chandler Bing, Ross's college buddy; however, later episodes retcon this, and she is shown to have met Chandler on Thanksgiving, whilst Ross was at college. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren.

                During the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously "gets off the plane". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final episode of the series.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Joey Tribbiani</h3>
            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"How you doin'?"</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                He is known for his simple-mindedness, trouble with understanding negative criticism of his acting, and love of food. He particularly loves meatball sub sandwiches. He also loves the "Joey Special", two pizzas.

            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Joey's simple-mindedness and lack of common sense are described most vividly in episodes "The One With Ross' New Girlfriend" and "The One Where Heckles Dies". In the former episode, Joey recommended Chandler to make suit in his family tailor's shop , and finally it revealed Joey's tailor had taken advantage of him and his family for 16 years. In the latter episode, Joey metioned "When I first moved to this city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple, it made me nuts" without realizing the common sense, girls don't have Adam's apple. He is something of an idiot savant in matters of romance, which generated his popular catchphrase, and pickup line, "How you doin'?".
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Joey, who in the past lived with Chandler for most of the show, has also shared apartments with Phoebe (for short amount of time), Ross and Rachel. Joey has always been able to get the girl he desired, but has never been able to maintain or shown any interest in a long-term relationship. He's had countless number of flings, but no serious relationships. His acting career has been a roller coaster ride, as at one time he was the lead in soap opera, then auditioning for TV commercials and then almost leading in a movie that never happened; his biggest success was starring in Days of Our Lives. At a point in the show, he revealed that he had never felt for anyone, like he did for Rachel, which created a lot of tension between Rachel, Ross and himself, but was only saddened when Rachel rejected him. More confusion occurred, when Rachel thought he had proposed to her, but now has all been cleared up. Currently living by himself, Joey has gotten over Rachel and moved on, but yet to find love.
