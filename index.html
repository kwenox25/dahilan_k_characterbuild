            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"NO UTERUS, NO OPINION!"</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Rachel Karen Greene (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likable daughter of Dr. Leonard Green (Ron Leibman), a rich, Long Island vascular surgeon, and Sandra Green (Marlo Thomas). She has two sisters, Jill (Reese Witherspoon) and Amy (Christina Applegate). Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry Farber, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents. She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three attended Lincoln High School. In the first episode, she is also reacquainted with Chandler Bing, Ross's college buddy; however, later episodes retcon this, and she is shown to have met Chandler on Thanksgiving, whilst Ross was at college. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren.

                During the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously "gets off the plane". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final episode of the series.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Ross Geller</h3>
            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"We were on a break!"</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Dr. Ross Geller, while generally good natured, is often clumsy, sometimes selfish and socially awkward. He is the only member with a doctorate. And, as such, he can be quite arrogant. In most cases, however, his arrogance eventually backfires and/or gets the best of him. For example, in The One With Chandler's Dad, Ross repeatedly mocks Rachel for her fast driving. However, at the end of the episode, it's he who gets a ticket, but for driving too slow. In later seasons, Ross is also shown to be quite irritable, often breaking into angry outbursts over the slightest things. For example, in The One With Ross's Sandwich, Ross is sentenced to a temporary work sabbatical after yelling at his boss for stealing his sandwich.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Somewhat surprisingly, in spite of his nerdy nature, Ross has dated a considerable number of attractive women throughout the series. Most of his dates, however, were disrupted and/or completely ruined once his paranoia or geekiness got the best of him. For example, in The One With All The Resolutions, Ross's date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle is disrupted when his legs become too hot/sweaty from his leather pants, at which he attempts to pull his tight pants off in her bathroom with little success.

                Ross, a paleontologist, began the show on a downside, after his wife left him and announced that she was a lesbian. This complicated Ross' life, as he had a son with Carol, and he didn't get along with her lover (Susan). It took Ross a considerable amount of time to get over Carol, however then coming to release that he still had feelings for Rachel. It took him a long time to disclose these feelings to her, and by the time she acknowledged them (through Chandler), Ross had already found someone else. They eventually got together, however their relationship was very rough and finally came to an end. Ross then got married for the second time to Emily, however this didn't last long because he said Rachel's name at the alter instead of Emily's. Ross then had a drunken marriage with Rachel, which took place in Vegas, and like the second one, this one didn't last long. Ross lived by himself throughout most of the show, however now living with Rachel; raising their baby named Emma.

            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"They don’t know that we know they know we know."</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan (born November 1, 1967) is played by Lisa Kudrow. Her claims to fame include her guitar playing in Central Perk and her elaborate improbable stories about her previous lives. Phoebe was known throughout the series as the eccentric, sometimes unintelligent but street smart, friend.

            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Phoebe, undoubtedly, the un canniest character on the show, her challenging childhood would explain this. A masseuse, who's never really had a long-term relationship, and has never been quite understood. Phoebe started with a career by playing guitar in Central Perk, producing songs, the most famous being "Smelly Cat". Phoebe has had some memorable occasions, usually occurring with other family members such as discovering whom her real mother is, meeting her father, delivering triplets for her brother and her eccentric relationship with her twin sister. Phoebe has never had a constant roommate; in the past she's shared apartments with Ross, Rachel and Monica, now living by herself. As the show comes to an end, will Phoebe finally settle down?

            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"How you doin'?"</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                He is known for his simple-mindedness, trouble with understanding negative criticism of his acting, and love of food. He particularly loves meatball sub sandwiches. He also loves the "Joey Special", two pizzas.

            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Joey's simple-mindedness and lack of common sense are described most vividly in episodes "The One With Ross' New Girlfriend" and "The One Where Heckles Dies". In the former episode, Joey recommended Chandler to make suit in his family tailor's shop , and finally it revealed Joey's tailor had taken advantage of him and his family for 16 years. In the latter episode, Joey metioned "When I first moved to this city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple, it made me nuts" without realizing the common sense, girls don't have Adam's apple. He is something of an idiot savant in matters of romance, which generated his popular catchphrase, and pickup line, "How you doin'?".
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Joey, who in the past lived with Chandler for most of the show, has also shared apartments with Phoebe (for short amount of time), Ross and Rachel. Joey has always been able to get the girl he desired, but has never been able to maintain or shown any interest in a long-term relationship. He's had countless number of flings, but no serious relationships. His acting career has been a roller coaster ride, as at one time he was the lead in soap opera, then auditioning for TV commercials and then almost leading in a movie that never happened; his biggest success was starring in Days of Our Lives. At a point in the show, he revealed that he had never felt for anyone, like he did for Rachel, which created a lot of tension between Rachel, Ross and himself, but was only saddened when Rachel rejected him. More confusion occurred, when Rachel thought he had proposed to her, but now has all been cleared up. Currently living by himself, Joey has gotten over Rachel and moved on, but yet to find love.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Monica Geller</h3>
            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You’re gonna love it."</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Monica "Mon" 'Elizabeth' Geller-Bing (born April 22, 1969) is known as the mother hen of the group, hosting them at her apartment most of the time and for special occasions such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive cleanliness (classifying places by cleanliness, where 'Monica-clean' is even cleaner than 'Health-Department-clean' (The One With The Male Nanny)). She is also known to talk abnormally loudly (such as in The One With The Apothecary Table) and for her bossiness and unnatural organizational skills (such as The One On The Last Night). Phoebe and Rachel also call her high-maintainece (in The One With The Joke).
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                During the start of the show Monica was somewhat the "leader" of the gang. Helping Ross get over his failed marriage, and helping Rachel get beyond Barry, she was the bond of the group, keeping them together. As the show progresses she does have several relationships, her most serious one was with Richard. However Richard wouldn't provide her with the one thing she desired most, and that was to start a family. Living in an apartment with Rachel brought her some memorable times. Her success in the love department seemed to be stationary for a considerable length of time, until she got to together with Chandler, and eventually falling in love with him. Marrying Chandler made her life complete. Now living peacefully with Chandler, she wants to start a family, by bringing a baby into their lives.

            <h4>Iconic Line: <span>"I'm not great at advise. Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?"</span></h4>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Chandler Muriel Bing (born April 8, 1968) is often considered the most popular Friends character, closely followed by Phoebe. His immense popularity stems from his overall good nature and legendary wit. The relationship he has with Monica is arguably the most genuine love story in the series, even more so than the famous Ross and Rachel pair. Chandler has a large following of female fans because of his romantic nature, and is generally considered "husband material" because of the way he treats Monica.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                From a romantic hopeless, to a lovesick husband. Towards the beginning of the show, and pretty much up to 5th season, Chandler wasn't able to maintain a long-term relationship. With his lack of romance, Chandler used humor to keep himself somewhat sane. Initially sharing an apartment with Joey, this was Indisputably the greatest "era" of friends. One of his on/off relationships was with Janice, which did end because ironically, he was over committed. One of his most serious relationships ended with sorrow, that being with Kathy, due to a lack of trust. Then came London (baby!), where Chandler first hooked up with Monica. Their relationship originally started out as a casual fling, but turned out to be the one of the greatest achievement of Chandler's, at one time "meaningless" life. Since then Chandler is happily married to Monica, and hoping to start a family. Who would have ever thought?
